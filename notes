Make the (main) objective as simple as possible!!!

Split agent algorithm into two separate objective handlers:
    - pathfinding algorithm (A*) --> ℵ* (aleph*)
    - environment exploration algorithm


1. Use ℵ* to move within one map location.
2. Treat overworld map as a node network.
3. Discover nodes during exploration and save in node graph.
4. Use A* algorithm to navigate overworld node graph.
(5. Use ConvNet to determine if goal node is reached.)
5. Hard code goal node (map location).


Hypothesis: ACTIONC = number of possible actions for a given state (Node)
